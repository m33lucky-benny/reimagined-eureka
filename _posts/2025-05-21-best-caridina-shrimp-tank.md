If you've ever searched **“best shrimp tank setup for Caridina shrimp”**, chances are you've already lost shrimp… or you're scared you will.

Here’s the truth most guides won’t tell you:

👉 **Caridina shrimp don’t die because they’re “sensitive.” They die because the tank setup is wrong from day one.**

After setting up and maintaining Caridina tanks in **Singapore’s climate**, I’ll break down exactly what works, what doesn’t, and how to avoid the mistakes that wipe out entire colonies.

## Why Most Caridina Shrimp Tank Setups Fail

Most beginners copy **Neocaridina** setups and hope for the best.

That’s **mistake #1**.

Caridina shrimp require:

- **Stable water chemistry**
- **Active buffering soil**  
  👉 [Recommended active soil](https://s.shopee.sg/20oXAyGM1g)
- **Controlled mineral levels**
- **Patience (not shortcuts)**

Miss even one, and you’ll see:

- Failed molts  
- Sudden deaths  
- No breeding  
- *“Healthy today, dead tomorrow”* syndrome

---

## Best Tank Size for Caridina Shrimp (Bigger Is Safer)

### ✅ Recommended Tank Size
**45–60 cm tank (≈30L) minimum**

**Why this works:**

- Larger water volume = more stable parameters  
- Easier to control GH & TDS  
- Slower swings = fewer deaths  
- Better temperature stability (**critical in tropical climates**)

❌ **Nano tanks (<15L)** are challenging even for experienced keepers.  
While some succeed with ~20L setups, beginners should start larger for stability.

---

## The ONLY Substrate That Works Reliably for Caridina

### ✅ Active Buffering Soil (Non-Negotiable)

- **ADA Amazonia V1** *(if you can find it)*
- **Geilee Nature Soil**  
  👉 [View product](https://s.shopee.sg/8APAWISTor)

**Why active soil matters:**

- Buffers pH to ~5.8–6.2  
- Stabilizes acidic conditions Caridina need  
- Supports long-term health and breeding  
- Effective for **12–24 months** before buffering weakens

> **Important:** Once buffering capacity is gone, you’ll need to replace the soil or add supplemental buffering methods.

❌ Inert gravel + chemicals = unstable tank + dead shrimp.

---

## Water Setup — This Is Where Most People Kill Shrimp

### ❌ Tap Water (Even “Good” Tap Water)

- Inconsistent  
- Unknown GH/KH swings  
- Often causes molting failure  

### ✅ Correct Water Setup
- **RO water**  
  👉 [RO water source](https://s.shopee.sg/7pmK99SBgS)
- **Shrimp-specific remineralizer**  
  👉 [Recommended remineralizer](https://s.shopee.sg/6KxWMQXmHH?share_channel_code=1)

### Target Parameters

| Parameter | Ideal Range |
|--------|-------------|
| pH | 5.8 – 6.5* |
| GH | 4 – 6 |
| KH | 0 – 1 |
| TDS | 90 – 130 |
| Temperature | 20 – 24°C |

\* While some breeders run **pH 5.3–5.5** for high-grade breeding, **5.8–6.5** is easier to maintain and perfectly suitable for healthy colonies.

---

### Water Change Protocol (TDS Control)

Even with RO water, **minerals accumulate over time**.

- 10–20% water change **weekly**
- Always match **temperature & TDS**
- Monitor TDS weekly  
- If TDS >150 → increase water change frequency

This step alone dramatically improves survival rates.

---

## Temperature Control for Singapore’s Climate

Singapore’s ambient temperatures often exceed Caridina limits.

**Ideal range:** 20–24°C

### Cooling Options

- **Computer fans (budget)**  
  Lower temperature by ~2–3°C via evaporation  
- **Aquarium chiller (most reliable)**  
  Precise, year-round control  
- **Air-conditioning**  
  Keep room at 23–25°C for multiple tanks

Without temperature control, **perfect parameters still won’t save shrimp** during hot weather.

---

## Filtration — Gentle, Not Powerful

### ✅ Best Filter for Caridina Shrimp

- Sponge filter  
- Gentle airflow  
- Shrimplet-safe intake  

Strong flow stresses shrimp and disrupts feeding and breeding.

**Simple > powerful.**

---

## Cycling the Tank (The Step Everyone Rushes)

Caridina tanks **must** be fully cycled.

### Minimum Cycling Time
**6–8 weeks**

### Signs Your Tank Is Ready

- Stable TDS (not fluctuating daily)  
- Zero ammonia & nitrite for **2+ weeks**  
- Visible biofilm  
- Stable pH in target range  

Rushing this step is the fastest way to waste money on shrimp.

---

## Acclimation Protocol (Where Many Lose Shrimp)

Even perfect tanks fail without proper acclimation.

### Proper Acclimation Steps

1. Float bag for **15–20 min** (temperature match)  
2. **Drip acclimate 2–3 hours**
   - Airline tubing
   - 1–2 drips per second
   - Match new water volume at minimum  
3. Net shrimp into tank (**do not pour bag water**)  
4. Lights off for **24 hours**

This prevents osmotic shock and molting failures.

---

## Plants & Hardscape (Less Is More)

### Best Choices

- Mosses (Java moss, Christmas moss)  
- Cholla wood  
- Indian almond leaves  

### Benefits

- Natural grazing  
- Reduced stress  
- Higher shrimplet survival  
- Beneficial tannins  

Avoid complex aquascapes that trap waste early on.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Changing parameters too fast  
❌ Overfeeding  
❌ Chasing numbers daily  
❌ Mixing Caridina with Neocaridina  
❌ Copying YouTube setups blindly  
❌ Adding shrimp before full cycle  
❌ Poor acclimation  
❌ Ignoring temperature in tropical climates  

**Caridina shrimp reward stability, not micromanagement.**

## Ongoing Maintenance Checklist

### Weekly
- 10–20% RO water change  
- Check TDS  
- Feed lightly 2–3× per week  

### Monthly
- Test GH & pH  
- Clean sponge filter (tank water only)  
- Check for parameter drift  

### Every 6 Months
- Refresh botanicals  
- Inspect filtration  

### Every 12–24 Months
- Assess soil buffering  
- Replace substrate if instability appears
