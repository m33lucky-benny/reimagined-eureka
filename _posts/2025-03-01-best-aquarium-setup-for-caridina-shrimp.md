## Best Aquarium Setups for Caridina Shrimp  
*What has actually worked for me as a breeder*

When I first started keeping Caridina shrimp, I did what most beginners do — I overcomplicated everything. I chased perfect numbers, adjusted parameters too often, and expected results far too quickly.

After more than two years of breeding Caridina shrimp — starting as a hobby and now running fully commercial tanks with **Blue King Kong Stardust** and **Boas** — I’ve learned one simple truth:

> **Stable setups outperform “perfect” setups every time.**

This article is not theory. It’s based on the exact aquarium setups I use today for consistent breeding, strong survival rates, and reliable color quality.

---

### Why Aquarium Setup Matters for Caridina Shrimp

Caridina shrimp are not difficult because they need perfect water — they are difficult because they react badly to **instability**.

Most failures come from:
- Overfeeding
- Over-filtering
- Chasing pH numbers
- Changing things too often

A good Caridina setup should do three things:
1. Keep water parameters stable  
2. Provide gentle flow and biofilm  
3. Be easy to maintain long-term  

Everything else is secondary.

---

### Tank Size: What Actually Works

For breeding, my preferred tank size is **60 × 30 cm**.

This size provides:
- Better water stability  
- Easy observation  
- Manageable maintenance  

Smaller tanks fluctuate faster, while larger tanks take longer to adjust. For complete beginners, **60 × 30 cm is forgiving and consistent**.

---

### Bare Bottom with Side UGF

I run **bare-bottom tanks with a side under-gravel filter (UGF)**.

This layout:
- Keeps waste visible and easy to remove  
- Prevents debris buildup in soil  
- Improves long-term survival rate  
- Simplifies maintenance  

While full soil tanks look nice, bare-bottom setups are far more reliable for breeding.

---

### Substrate Choice

When soil is needed, I prefer:
- **ADA Amazonia V1** (when available)  
- **Geilee soil** as an alternative  

Soil alone does not guarantee success. I always monitor **both soil condition and water parameters** using meters. Stability matters more than brand choice.

---

### Water Parameters I Use

I use **RO water remineralized with SL Aqua**, keeping parameters within this range:

- **pH:** 5.3 – 5.5  
- **TDS:** 100 – 120  
- **GH:** 5 – 7  
- **Temperature:** 22 – 24°C  

These values are not magic numbers. What matters most is that they **do not fluctuate**.

> A stable pH of 5.5 is better than a perfect pH that keeps changing.

---

### Filtration and Water Flow

My filtration setup is simple:
- **Bio sponge filter**  
- **Side UGF**  

This combination provides gentle flow, strong biological filtration, and a safe environment for shrimplets.

Strong flow stresses shrimp and pushes food away too quickly. Calm water allows shrimp to graze naturally.

I also use **java moss** to slow water movement in high-flow areas.

---

### Plants: Functional, Not Decorative

I keep planting minimal.

**Java moss** is more than enough:
- Encourages biofilm growth  
- Traps food particles  
- Protects baby shrimp  
- Softens water flow  

Heavy planting is unnecessary and often hides problems like uneaten food.

---

### Feeding Strategy

I feed **once a week** when there is a **green wall**.

Overfeeding is the fastest way to crash a Caridina tank. Healthy shrimp spend most of their time grazing naturally.

> If you’re unsure whether to feed — don’t.

---

### Maintenance Routine

- **Water changes:** Once per week  
- **Volume:** Small and controlled  
- **TDS:** Closely matched  

I avoid large corrective water changes. Small, consistent changes maintain stability far better.

---

### Case Study: A Breeding Tank I Run

**Tank setup:**
- Tank size: 60 × 30 cm  
- Bottom: Bare  
- Soil: ADA V1 / Geilee  
- Filtration: Sponge filter + side UGF  
- Water: RO + SL Aqua  
- Temperature: 22 – 24°C  
- Plants: Java moss  
- Feeding: Green wall once weekly  

**Results:**
- Strong survival rate  
- Consistent breeding  
- Stable color quality in Blue King Kong Stardust and Boas  

If I had to restart this tank today, I wouldn’t change much.

---

### Common Beginner Mistakes

- Feeding too often  
- Chasing perfect pH  
- Using strong water flow  
- Overcomplicating the setup  
- Constantly adjusting a stable tank  

---

### Final Thoughts

The best aquarium setup for Caridina shrimp is not the most expensive or complicated one.

It’s the setup that:
- Stays stable  
- Is easy to maintain  
- Allows shrimp to behave naturally  

Start simple. Observe more than you adjust. Let the tank mature.

That’s how long-term breeding success happens.
