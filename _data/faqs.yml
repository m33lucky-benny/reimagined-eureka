      question: What are Caridina shrimp and why are they popular in Singapore?
      answer: >
        Caridina shrimp are premium freshwater dwarf shrimp known for their vivid
        colors and patterns, including Crystal Red Shrimp (CRS), Crystal Black Shrimp (CBS),
        and Taiwan Bee varieties. In Singapore, they are popular due to their beauty,
        peaceful nature, and strong breeding potential.

      question: Can Caridina shrimp survive in Singapore without a chiller?
      answer: >
        Yes, but long-term success is difficult. Caridina shrimp thrive at 20–24°C,
        while Singapore’s ambient temperature often exceeds 28°C. Air-conditioning or
        aquarium cooling fans can help, but most serious shrimp keepers use a chiller
        for stable breeding and longevity.

      question: Why do Caridina shrimp die after molting?
      answer: >
        Molting deaths are usually caused by unstable water parameters. Common reasons
        include incorrect GH, calcium deficiency, high KH, or sudden changes in TDS,
        pH, or temperature.

      question: What are the ideal water parameters for Caridina shrimp?
      answer: >
        pH 6.0–6.8, TDS 100–200 ppm, GH 4–6, KH 0–2, Temperature 20–24°C.
        Stability is more important than chasing exact numbers.

      question: How long should I cycle a tank before adding Caridina shrimp?
      answer: >
        A minimum of 4–8 weeks is recommended to allow beneficial bacteria, active soil
        stabilization, and biofilm development. Ammonia and nitrite should be 0 ppm
        before adding shrimp.

      question: How many Caridina shrimp should I start with?
      answer: >
        Start with at least 20 shrimp. Larger groups improve breeding success and
        reduce losses due to stress.

      question: What should I feed Caridina shrimp?
      answer: >
        Feed high-quality shrimp food 2–3 times per week. Supplement with blanched
        vegetables, biofilm enhancers, and limited protein treats.

      question: How do I know if my Caridina shrimp are healthy?
      answer: >
        Healthy shrimp are active grazers with strong coloration and regular molting.
        Signs of stress include lethargy, pale color, and failed molts.

      question: What makes a good Caridina shrimp tank?
      answer: >
        A good Caridina tank prioritizes stable water parameters, active soil,
        gentle filtration, and a mature biological balance.

    - id: t2
      question: What tank size is best for beginners?
      answer: >
        Tanks between 45–60 cm are ideal. Larger volumes are more stable and easier
        for beginners to manage in Singapore’s climate.

    - id: t3
      question: What equipment is essential for a Caridina shrimp tank?
      answer: >
        Essential equipment includes active shrimp soil, gentle filtration
        (UGF or sponge filter), reliable cooling (chiller or AC),
        and an RO water system.

      question: What is the benefit of a custom shrimp tank setup?
      answer: >
        Custom tanks are designed specifically for Caridina shrimp, reducing
        trial-and-error and improving long-term survival and breeding success.

    - id: t5
      question: Can existing tanks be upgraded for Caridina shrimp?
      answer: >
        Yes. Filtration, substrate, and cooling systems can be upgraded to make most
        tanks Caridina-compatible.

    - id: t6
      question: Proper acclimation process?
      answer: >
        Drip acclimation over 1–2 hours is recommended. Never pour bag water directly
        into the tank.

    - id: t7
      question: Can I keep Caridina shrimp with fish?
      answer: >
        Species-only tanks are best. Safe tankmates include Otos, small rasboras,
        and pygmy cories.
